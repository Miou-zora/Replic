### How it works ?
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a github developper token with all permissions (I don't know which one you must take)
3. Change `[your token]` of `data.json` file by ... your token (NO WAY?!?). So, it should looks like this: 
    ```json
    {
    "token": "itsnotatokenbutyoumayunderstand"
    }
    ```
4. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/) (Don't you already have it?). Then    download [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and, with it, download [PyGithub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub).
5. Now, you can simply use it like this:
    ```so-you-are-a-man-of-culture-as-well
    ./main.py [an ssh link]
    ```
    Where `[an ssh link]` must be replaced by an ssh link of an Epitech project. So, it should looks like this:
    ```may-be-the-best-project-ever
    ./main.py git@github.com:EpitechPromo20XX/B-DOP-200-NAN-2-1-chocolatine-your.name.git
    ```

And that's all! You can now create mirrors of any Epitech project with a little (and free :wink:) CI/CD workflow.
