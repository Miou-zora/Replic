### Execution

To execute the project, there is help for it:
```
usage: main.py [-h] [--friend FRIEND] [--mirror-name MIRROR_NAME] [--commit COMMIT] sshKey

A beautiful mirror-generator.

positional arguments:
  sshKey                SSH key(s) to be added to the mirror repository.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --friend FRIEND, -f FRIEND
                        Can add friend to mirror repository.
  --mirror-name MIRROR_NAME, -m MIRROR_NAME
                        Change the mirror repository name.
  --commit COMMIT, -o COMMIT
                        change the first commit push to the main repository
```
(You can also use `python3 main.py -h` for more informations)

## How to report a bug

If you find a bug, you can open an issue on the repository with bug report template.

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you want to suggest a feature or enhancement, you can open an issue on the repository with feature template.

## Where can I ask for help?

You can ask for help to [me](https://github.com/Miou-zora) or on the issue/PR.

(When interacting with me, please be a human being)

## Coding style

We use pep8 coding style for this project. You can use `make coding_style` to check if your code is pep8 compliant and `make coding_style_details` to have more details about the pep8 errors.

## Commit format

In the project, we use [Angular Commit Convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)

## Labels

Each labels must be the type of the Issue.

## Branch

### Namming

Branch should have an automatic namming due to branch creation via issues. But if you create a branch from nothing you must use this template:

_branch-name_/_branch-description_

## Pull Requests (PR)

### Namming

If you create a PR, you must use this template:

[_pr name_] _pr description_

(In most of the case, you can reuse issue name)

### Process

#### Code review

For each PR we'll have a code review, the PR must be approved by [myself](https://github.com/Miou-zora).

#### PR Stability

Look at the [**Testing Policies**](#testing-policies)

#### Miscellaneous

Don't add to Replic github project except if the PR it.

Don't add to any Milestone of the project. If you doubt, ask it to [me](https://github.com/Miou-zora).

You can speak in French or English in the PR because I french and it's sometimes easier for me to talk in french above all for code review.

## Milestone

Milestone are used to organize the project. Each milestone must have a description and a due date. A milestone should be linked to an issue or a PR. A milestone should be linked to a set of functionnalities that makes the project works or a set of functionnalities that makes the project coh√©rent.

### Namming

If you create a milestone, you must use this template:

[_milestone-name_] _milestone description_

## Testing Policies

### Unit tests

Library: [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)

### Unit tests (AI, GUI)

Please do unit tests if you can. We don't have a coverage goal for the moment.

### Functional tests

We don't force you to do functional tests other than indicated in issues but if you can do it, it's better.

### CI / CD

We have a really basic CI at the moment.
